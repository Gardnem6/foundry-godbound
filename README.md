# Godbound Foundry Module

An incomplete (but usable!) Foundry system module for running Godbound games.

## Dependencies

The following module is recommended, though not required:

When you are uploading your Godbound PDFs to PDFoundry journal entries, use the PDF codes CORE (for the core rule book) and LEXICON (for Lexicon of the Throne).

## TODO

The following features are not mechanically supported by this system at 
this time:
* Strifes
* Low Magic
* Damage Automation
