The steeds automatically move at least slightly faster than any creature they chase, pursuing it through land, water, or air. These steeds can be slain by any magical damage, but may be easily summoned again.","constant":false,"instant":false,"onTurn":false,"action":true,"smite":false,"noEffort":true,"atWill":false,"scene":false,"day":false,"greater":false,"combatPower":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9kLb9OnQ3UEYBEz7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.sjBflJvvRk0J7q6z"}},"_id":"8JZTniltAGUru6pC"}
