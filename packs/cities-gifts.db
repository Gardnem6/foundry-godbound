These created citizens will obey the Godbound utterly until destroyed or the Godbound uses this gift again, after which the prior creations become free but well-disposed toward their creator, though they won't risk their newfound lives for them. The citizens fight as normal human soldiers and are equipped with the ordinary skills and tools of their intended roles. If created out of nothing the citizens are extremely lifelike constructs with no true will to do anything but carry out their roles. If used in a location where an adequate number of recently dead or persistently undead human souls still linger, the spirits can inhabit the newly-made bodies, becoming real people who may or may not recall much of their former lives or identities. Both automatons and imbued bodies will disintegrate if they leave the city afterwards, but soul-imbued bodies can reproduce to produce perfectly normal human children.","constant":false,"instant":false,"onTurn":false,"action":true,"smite":false,"noEffort":true,"atWill":false,"scene":false,"day":false,"greater":true,"combatPower":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9kLb9OnQ3UEYBEz7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.R332cWejKvjEpzQF"}},"_id":"Lx9F9bU02bioF8MA"}

Even worthy foes will automatically treat you as on a par with the existing ruler, though they may extend you no more deference than they would the mayor.
