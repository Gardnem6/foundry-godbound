You shift your consciousness into a suitable receptacle connected by an adequately wide data pipe. If it's a hardwired connection, the transfer takes a Main Action.

Committed Effort remains Committed, though hit point loss does not transfer. Assuming the availability of common parts, it takes you no more than 24 hours to build such a backup receptacle.
