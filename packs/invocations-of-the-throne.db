The tower is sealed against entry by any save the theurge and their chosen guests, though siege weapons or powerful magic can break through the walls and steel-hard windows of tinted glass.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThe tower naturally creates sufficient food, drink, and other common necessities to serve a hundred guests indefinitely. If taken from the tower, however, these viands crumble away in moments. So too the servitors if they are forced to leave its walls; they know this and will beg piteously to be spared such a death. Some theurges are said to have fashioned favored servants bodies in which to truly exist.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThe palace may be conjured anywhere there is sufficient relatively flat ground to support it and may be dispelled at the caster’s whim. Any foreign objects or persons left within the tower when it is dispelled will appear on the ground where it once stood, though the caster’s personal possessions may be left stored within whatever timeless pocket realm the tower goes to when it is dispelled.
