Implant a non-self-harming desire for a particular thing or action; if the target does not spend at least one action on its round pursuing that activity or seeking to obtain that thing, it suffers one point of emotional damage per level of the Godbound. If reduced to zero hit dice or hit points by this, it regains one hit point and becomes unable to do anything but pursue that desire for the remainder of the scene. Worthy foes can attempt a Spirit save to end the power at the start of each of their rounds, but each such save attempt inflicts one point of damage per Godbound level. Once a save is made, a target is immune to this gift for the rest of the scene.

The Godbound's words, gestures, and attention are so dizzying that the victim loses their ability to resist the hero's wishes. Their attention counts as a 1d10 magic weapon attack with a range sufficient to hit a target able to see them. Damage this gift does is emotional, eroding the victim's will; if reduced to zero hit points or hit dice by the effect, the victim regains one hit point and becomes the Godbound's utter thrall for the remainder of the scene, performing any non-suicidal act but regaining their self-control at its end.

If the target desires the offered thing badly and has no important reason to refuse the trade, it must accept it and perform their side of the trade in good faith. If the offered thing is inadequate recompense or the target has a powerful reason not to accept the trade, a worthy foe may make a Spirit save to resist this power and become immune to it for the scene. Lesser foes get no save even against terrible deals. This gift cannot induce a target to do something suicidal or profoundly contrary to their nature. If the Godbound promises a favor that they then fail to perform, they become unable to make any successful saving throw against the offended target or avoid any of their attack rolls for a year and a day thereafter. This gift is subtle, and an affected target will not usually suspect any magical influence unless the deal offered is obviously unequal.","constant":false,"instant":false,"onTurn":false,"action":true,"smite":false,"noEffort":true,"atWill":false,"scene":false,"day":false,"greater":true,"combatPower":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9kLb9OnQ3UEYBEz7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.m999kQX1GLeAdgv1"}},"_id":"TwNDb0wyQ5yhZzv3"}
