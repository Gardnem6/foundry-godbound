Most creatures of human intelligence do not qualify as beasts, though some exceptionally primal or savage entities might be treated as such. Miracles of the Beast Word involve adopting traits of animals, impressing these traits on others, full or hybrid shapeshifting, commanding beasts, or calling forth animals. Some powers grant the user the full or partial shape of an animal, or allow them to transform another. If used as a curse, the hero may inflict the animal’s intellect on the target or allow them to retain their own mind in their new shell.

Shapeshifting rules are described in detail on page 160. If using a creature's natural weaponry to attack, small but dangerous creatures use a 1d6 damage die, wolf- or bear-sized ones use a 1d8 damage die, and larger creatures use a 1d10 damage die.

A worshiper is an intelligent being who knowingly and willingly pledges to worship a Godbound or other deific Word-bound entity, such as a parasite god or Made God. The worshiper may be coerced by circumstances or threats, but cannot be magically compelled or induced. A worshiper may be a servant of only one deity at a time. Those who pledge to a pantheon have their worship assigned to the member god most suited to their nature, whether or not the worshiper is aware of it. Worshipers can turn against a god, but they can't renounce their state. The most they can do is find a new god to accept their loyalty. Gods always know whether or not a person is a worshiper of theirs, though they have no automatic insight into whether or not they are an obedient worshiper. They may reject a worshiper at any time, or accept a change of allegiance from another god's devotees. A god is not automatically made aware of a person's choice to worship them, though they can tell of that fact with a glance at the new worshiper. Gods always have custody of the souls of their devotees. They may damn their faithful dead to Hell at their will, but otherwise, the souls of the dead hover unseen and sleeping in the presence of their god, or are dispatched to the divinity's paradise. A soul unsheltered by a paradise will fall into Hell if their patron deity is slain.\n<br><br>\nThe only way to gain the gifts of apotheosis is through gaining character levels.

So also do they command a city's buildings and deeper structures, controlling stone and street as another Godbound might wield fire or furious lightning. Their abilities have little application outside such places, though they can summon forth buildings even in a barren waste, calling forth a city born from their own dreams and desires.\n\n<br><br>\n\nGodbound of Cities can move anywhere within a city, passing through walls and other constructions as if they were nonexistent. They can blend in perfectly with local inhabitants, speaking their language and knowing whatever is known about the city by an ordinary occupant.

Only worthy foes have any chance of piercing this citizen imposture, and that only after interaction at close range with a successful Spirit save. \n\n<br><br>\n\nMany of these powers apply only to or within cities. For purposes of this Word, a \"city\" is any self-identified, contiguous community consisting of more than 999 people, with its boundaries stretching as far as the furthest structures which are inhabited by people who consider themselves citizens of the city.

Your hero is a dread paragon among their kind, a fell and terrible serpent-lord who can bring terror to armies. This concept Word can be used to emulate all the classical abilities of dragons known to story and fable, whether their abilities are to easily devour masses of lesser creatures, exhibit tremendous physical power, or exert unnatural influence over the weak-willed.\n\n<br><br>\n\nIf your concept revolves around certain physical abilities such as great strength or swift-winged flight, you should purchase those gifts at the start of the game. For dragons that only occasionally call upon their wyrmish prowess or the magical flight abilities of the pearl in their brains, such gifts might be used as miracles instead.\n\n<br><br>\n\nYour hero is a dragon. Whatever the particular shape you might desire the dragon to take, you have a base Armor Class of 3, your unarmed attacks inflict 1d10 damage as a magic weapon, and your Strength is automatically raised to 18. You are whatever size both you and the GM agree is appropriate.","pdfCode":"LEXICON","pdfPage":40},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9kLb9OnQ3UEYBEz7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.RyuTEiOatLqIWxwa"}},"_id":"xM2LZY990VRh5Sgs"}
{"name":"Vengeance","type":"boundWord","img":"icons/tools/hand/scale-balances-merchant-brown.webp","data":{"description":"The Word of Vengeance demands a reckoning for crimes. It is not justice, however, but simple revenge that this Word rules: a hurt for a hurt, a sin for a sin. A Godbound of Vengeance inflicts pain and punishment on those who have first committed a crime. The Word does not strike first, but it often strikes last. Many powers of Vengeance involve offenses or crimes on a creature's part. It is up to the Godbound to decide what constitutes an offense, and even totally harmless acts can be construed as a crime if the Godbound wishes to take them as such. Other powers require that the Godbound have suffered hit point damage or been targeted by a hostile power; the GM decides what counts for the latter purpose.\n\n<br><br>\n\nGodbound of Vengeance repay what is owed. Their normal attacks always hit against a target who has inflicted hit point damage on them within the past round.","pdfCode":"LEXICON","pdfPage":34},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9kLb9OnQ3UEYBEz7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.XDeMxYaolahyxdtK"}},"_id":"xRv8jsF3VXlIEuyC"}
{"name":"Endurance","type":"boundWord","img":"icons/commodities/gems/gem-amber-insect-orange.webp","data":{"description":"The Word of Endurance is one of hardiness, determination, and unflagging exertion. Its miracles can grant survival even in the face of certain death, strength when exhaustion would otherwise overwhelm, and resistance against unwanted sorcery or curses. A Godbound graced with this Word is fearsomely difficult to harm physically, but the Word cannot deflect mental or spiritual damage sources or compulsions, like a Knowledge Divine Wrath or a Command compulsion. As a guide, if it would involve a Spirit save then Endurance can't stop it. Its miracles can't extend immunities to others unless noted otherwise.\n\n<br><br>\n\nHeroes of Endurance need not eat, sleep, drink, or breathe, and may set their Constitution score to 16, or 18 if it’s already 16 or higher.","pdfCode":"CORE","pdfPage":39},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9kLb9OnQ3UEYBEz7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.tJz4iBYObdGOw0Ii"}},"_id":"xgtVoGqKYrT6zpqP"}
{"name":"Artificial Intelligence","type":"boundWord","img":"icons/commodities/tech/bulb-vacuum.webp","data":{"description":"Synthetic minds may or may not exist generally in the wider campaign world, but you are a singularly powerful exemplar among them. You have the ability to exhibit seemingly supernatural levels of prediction and analysis, and can effortlessly manipulate the data flows around you. Unlike the Word of Networks, however, you cannot simply create telecommunications hardware; you must work with the gross matter you have to hand.\n\n<br><br>\n\nYou are a super-intelligent artificial mind. Your Intelligence score becomes 19, granting a +4 attribute bonus. Your physical attributes and hit points represent the body or device your mind inhabits, whatever shape it may possess; if robotic, this body requires neither sustenance nor rest. You cannot transfer your intelligence from this body or survive its destruction without appropriate gifts. Your body is automatically wirelessly connected to any local computing network or device that lacks divine-level computer security.","pdfCode":"LEXICON","pdfPage":39},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9kLb9OnQ3UEYBEz7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ucVSBS4IrkWXCeSh"}},"_id":"xkff3gQQjkzErQc5"}

Some Godbound express their affinity through a particular form of crafting, such as blacksmithing or shipbuilding, while others are patrons of a broader range of creative labor. Even focused artisans can use their powers generally, however. Miracles of Artifice involve the creation, command, repair, or destruction of physical objects.\n\n<br><br>\n\nHeroes with the Artifice Word can create any non-magical object a normal man can carry as a round’s action, using whatever materials are to hand. While the ensuing creation may look odd, and any \"foodstuffs\" are inedible, it functions and lasts as well as a normal object of its type and usual substance.
