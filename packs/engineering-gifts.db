While this technology is too cumbersome or finicky to be useful on adventures or in combat, it can act as a justification for purposes of Dominion spends, making Impossible changes Implausible, or Implausible ones Plausible. Depending on the Godbound's effort at spreading this technology, it may gradually pervade the campaign's baseline technological base as well, thus allowing the Godbound's innate device-creation powers to take advantage of it and permitting ordinary engineers to build it. Until the tech becomes baseline, the Godbound's unique genius is required to construct and direct it. While this gift can be used as a miracle, unless it is taken as a gift, it can never be maintained effectively enough to allow the tech to ever become a baseline part of the campaign.","constant":true,"instant":false,"onTurn":false,"action":false,"smite":false,"noEffort":true,"atWill":false,"scene":false,"day":false,"greater":true,"combatPower":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9kLb9OnQ3UEYBEz7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.GJdcl1pwhF4Y9ncs"}},"_id":"jdxQ5LWfXrTugl5A"}
