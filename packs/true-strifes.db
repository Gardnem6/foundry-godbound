The Strife of the Dying Hour draws on that eternal conflict, imbuing its practitioners with the arts of temporal erosion and lethal time-manipulation. As the art's scorn for material objects is so fundamental, its practitioners cannot use it while wearing armor or wielding weapons, as such reliance on base matter is contrary to its ways.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThis strife disallows armor or weapon use with it.","pdfCode":"CORE","pdfPage":218},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"rCveCjeCKm0rhl1y":3},"flags":{}}

It is a subtle art, its strikes made invisibly by its adepts and the damage it does concealed until combat finally erupts. It functions most effectively as a tool of treachery, turning old friendships and former romances into weapons against the adept’s enemies. Most adepts of the Scorned Lover are beguiling and liberal in their charms, knowing that every kiss and every promise is just another weapon in their arsenal.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThis Strife disallows armor and non-light weapon use with it.","pdfCode":"CORE","pdfPage":221},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"rCveCjeCKm0rhl1y":3},"flags":{}}

Adepts of the True Flame can burn their own life force to ensure that their attacks strike home. The instinctive terror of flame scourges their foes, and the indiscriminate hunger of their fire devours the foes that surround them. Practitioners of this art are often marked by their ferocity and self-sacrificial violence.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThis Strife may be used with any armor and with melee weapons.","pdfCode":"CORE","pdfPage":216},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"rCveCjeCKm0rhl1y":3},"flags":{}}

The Strife of the Drowning Tide mimics that all-consuming ruin, flowing in and crushing the multitudes that would dare oppose its adepts. While less efficient against a single potent foe, the Strife has ways of swiftly washing away packs of lesser enemies.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThis Strife allows any armor and any two-handed melee weapon.","pdfCode":"CORE","pdfPage":217},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"rCveCjeCKm0rhl1y":3},"flags":{}}

The adept of this Strife becomes almost impossible to detect until the moment they finally spring, and the packs of domestic hounds or guard animals that their prey might muster fall inevitably beneath red talons. Adepts of this Strife are known for sometimes taking on bestial physical aspects, occasionally extending to claws, fur, or animalistic facial features.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThis Strife disallows armor or non-melee weapon use with it.","pdfCode":"CORE","pdfPage":220},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"rCveCjeCKm0rhl1y":3},"flags":{}}

The Strife of the Broken Earth mimics that catastrophic upheaval, shaking what is solid and defying what is secure.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThe Strife of the Broken Earth is particularly effective for smashing inanimate objects and destroying fortifications. It has few attacks meant to instantly overwhelm a foe, but instead focuses on grinding, remorseless assaults that eventually wear down the strongest enemy. Fleeing is useless when even the ground beneath you seeks your death.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThis Strife may be used with any armor and with melee weapons.","pdfCode":"CORE","pdfPage":215},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"rCveCjeCKm0rhl1y":3},"flags":{}}

A rival can be the kind of goad that no lesser prod can be, inspiring the warrior to new heights of ferocity if only to prove themselves the greater. The Strife of the Bitter Rival embodies this violence and strengthens its adepts when they face their chosen rivals.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThis Strife is a superb dueling style, and it excels when the adept has only a single enemy to face.

It is a strife of hurled bodies and thunderous blows, with an adept’s own fall a weapon against all below them. The downward blows of a master of the True Strife can crush stone barriers and human bones just as readily, and their terrible leaping strikes can pierce overhead cover with ease. An adept of the strife will usually move more by leaping than running when in a fight, relying on their thunderous landing to weaken strong enemies and cull weak ones. The True Strife is most often taught by supernatural beings of Sun, Night, or Sky, though only the most gifted can master its secrets.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThis strife disallows armor and non-projectile weapon use with it.","pdfCode":"CORE","pdfPage":219},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"rCveCjeCKm0rhl1y":3},"flags":{}}
