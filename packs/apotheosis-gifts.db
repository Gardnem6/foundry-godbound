These usually are a subconscious sussurus of petitions, but they can specifically “listen” for particular topics or people if they wish, becoming alerted when those topics arise or those people address them. The Godbound can communicate with their faithful during their prayers, though this inward voice is subtle and does not compel obedience.","constant":true,"instant":false,"onTurn":false,"action":false,"smite":false,"noEffort":true,"atWill":false,"scene":false,"day":false,"greater":false,"combatPower":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9kLb9OnQ3UEYBEz7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.BtTQdP0WzhlDSCZc"}}}

When properly consecrated, the Godbound can choose to perceive anything going on within their precincts, though they must intentionally choose to watch. They can target a gift or miracle at any person within the sacred grounds at the usual costs in Effort. Such a marvel is free the first time the Godbound so acts in a day, but each successive wonder requires the Godbound to Commit Effort for the day. Properly sanctifying a shrine requires rites and components costing Wealth equal to the Godbound's level, with increases in their level requiring additional expenditures. If the shrine is desecrated, it must be reconsecrated at the full cost.","constant":false,"instant":false,"onTurn":false,"action":true,"smite":false,"noEffort":true,"atWill":false,"scene":false,"day":false,"greater":false,"combatPower":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9kLb9OnQ3UEYBEz7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.x95n7TGIan9TZW9g"}}}

If the faction has a number of worshipers present equal in number to a group of one Power size smaller, the Godbound can selectively add or subtract 2 from any action die roll they take. Thus, if a city of Power 2 had a Power 1 village's worth of faithful among them, they would be subject to the Godbound's influence. The Godbound must be aware of the effort the faction is making to influence the roll, but usually only the most subtle and secretive actions can escape the notice of such a large number of worshipers and their pray.","constant":false,"instant":false,"onTurn":false,"action":true,"smite":false,"noEffort":true,"atWill":false,"scene":false,"day":false,"greater":false,"combatPower":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9kLb9OnQ3UEYBEz7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.4375verdivPZgTtw"}},"_id":"eRLdVK0hZCXjvbEN"}

One disciple may be chosen for each level of the Godbound, but only one high pontiff can be chosen. If you've access to the deluxe version of Godbound and the mortal creation rules, the disciples instantly become heroic mortals of a level equal to half their patron's level, rounded up and the high priest becomes a heroic mortal of the Godbound's level. Both usually take talents reflective of their patron's portfolio, including a gift or two. If the mortal hero rules are unavailable, treat the disciples as Skilled Mages or Major Heroes from the mortal section of the bestiary chapter, and the high priest as a lesser Eldritch. This consecrating process takes only a moment, but the consecration cannot be taken from the acolyte until they are dead, even if they later leave their god's service.","constant":false,"instant":false,"onTurn":false,"action":true,"smite":false,"noEffort":true,"atWill":false,"scene":false,"day":false,"greater":false,"combatPower":false},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9kLb9OnQ3UEYBEz7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.Za5tpYzU6UaRmIPf"}}}
