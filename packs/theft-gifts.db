You may steal either a memory or an object they are holding or wearing.

Worthy foes will sense the robbery if the stolen object is obvious. If you steal a memory, you must specify the particular memory to steal, one which cannot last more than a day in total. Worthy foes can save versus Spirit to resist memory theft. You cannot perceive the content of a stolen memory, but it remains unrecoverable until you choose to return it.
