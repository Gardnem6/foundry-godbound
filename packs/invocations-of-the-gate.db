The young and healthy add a month, while infants and children are the richest in life force and add two months apiece to the wizard’s longevity. The victims invariably perish during the ritual, and their souls are dragged down to Hell by the arcane forces involved in the rite. More than one victim can be sacrificed at once if they are all properly prepared.\n\n<br><br>\n\nThe renewed vitality granted by this ritual is permanent, but prolonged use invariably has a price.
