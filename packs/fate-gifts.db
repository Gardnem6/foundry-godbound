The Godbound dissolves into the present situation, becoming a faceless, overlooked member of some group of two or more people present: guards, gawking onlookers, undead legions, or even their own party of allies.

If the entire group is killed, they manifest next to one of the corpses with 1 hit point remaining. The Godbound may remain submerged in the group for up to one day, emerging at last in some place near a member of the group. While submerged in the group, they can take no action but get a general idea of what the group is doing and where its members are. Worthy foes can make a Spirit saving throw not to forget the Godbound was present, but actually forcing them back into their presence requires an appropriate miracle of dispelling or the extermination of the group.","constant":false,"instant":false,"onTurn":false,"action":true,"smite":false,"noEffort":false,"atWill":false,"scene":false,"day":true,"greater":true,"combatPower":true},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"9kLb9OnQ3UEYBEz7":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.ziEeBUCyQ5nKs7M4"}}}
